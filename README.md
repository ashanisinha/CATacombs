# Catacombs
Cats in Catacombs!
This is a 2D puzzle-adventure game where you play as a cat navigating the dark and dangerous catacombs. The goal is to escape alive while avoiding ghosts and managing your phone's battery, which powers your flashlightâ€”your only source of light in the maze.

Features
Randomized Movement Logic: Ghosts in the catacombs use a dynamic algorithm to generate unpredictable movement patterns, keeping the gameplay challenging and engaging.
Battery and Flashlight Mechanics: The game integrates a power management system where your phone's battery depletes over time, adding a layer of strategy as you navigate the maze.
Collision Detection: Ghosts and walls are programmed with precise collision detection, creating an immersive and interactive gameplay experience.
Lighting Effects: Dynamic lighting is implemented to simulate a realistic flashlight beam that diminishes as the battery runs out, enhancing the atmospheric tension.

Technical Details
Developed in Unity with C# scripting for game mechanics and logic.
Sprite animations for the cat and ghosts use Unity's Animator for fluid transitions.
